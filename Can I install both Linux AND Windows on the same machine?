Yes, just not one on top of the other. And in general terms it only requires free software and some labour.
    • If you have a comfortable amount of memory and disk space, from either Linux or Windows, you can use a technique called Virtualisation, which involves installing a Virtual Machine (VM) that runs the alternative Operating system. Virtual machines (VMs) are managed by specialised software such as Oracle VM Virtualbox. It is a good idea to have a shared disk area, such as the Downloads folder. This solution may slow down things, and you may be encouraged to add memory to your computer. The two operating systems will be sharing hardware resources all the time.
    • A technique called Containerisation also virtualises a machine with a different Operating System. A container carries the Operating System, installed applications and data, and can be moved around seamlessly in heterogeneous systems. The most commonly used software to do this is Docker. The containers do not run autonomously as VMs, they share software resources with the native Operating System that hosts them.
    • Alternatively, you can create a separate Disk Partition and install the second Operating System there. In this case they will not be running simultaneously, and as you will be starting one OS or the other (so, to change Operating Systems for always involve a reboot of the entire machine), this technique is called “Dual Boot”. Sharing files between the systems is a bit harder to set-up.
