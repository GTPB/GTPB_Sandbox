These two Operating Systems are not really compatible, as they manage and explore the hardware differently and use incompatible mechanisms to host applications. In other words you cannot expect to move around seamlessly. Specifically, software developed and installed in one system will not necessarily just run it in the other. A variety of workarounds do exist to reduce the impact of this incompatibility, however, generally at the expense of resources such as memory and disk space, resulting in significantly reduced program execution speeds.
